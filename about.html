<h1>Is Minesweeper Educational?</h1>
<div class="newspaper">
<ul>
<li>Mathematicians are starting to get excited about the computer game Minesweeper, included with Windows operating systems. Richard Kaye, a math professor in England, realized that a solution to a larger scale version of Minesweeper would be the solution to a 30-year-old mathematics conundrum known as the “P vs. NP” problem. To “celebrate mathematics in the new millennium,” the Clay Mathematics Institute of Cambridge, Massachusetts, announced its Millennium Prizes last May, offering US$1 million each for the correct solution to each of 7 famous, unsolved math problems. “P vs. NP” is on that list.<br></li>

<li>The object of Minesweeper is to avoid all the hidden mines on a square grid. When you click on a grid, you either find a mine (and lose) or get a number showing how many mines are in the squares around the one you just clicked. Kaye realized that this was exactly the kind of problem described by Stephen Cook back in 1971 and now referred to as P vs. NP. In very simplistic terms, the P vs. NP problem is described by the Clay Institute as follows:<br></li>

<li>    One of the outstanding problems in logic and computer science is determining whether questions exist whose answer can be quickly checked (for example by computer), but which require a much longer time to solve from scratch (without knowing the answer). There certainly seem to be many such questions. But so far no one has proved that any of them really does require a long time to solve …<br></li>

<li>If someone were to come up with an algorithm for successfully beating Minesweeper, that algorithm would also be instrumental in vastly improving encryption and code-cracking.<br></li>

<li>For more information, please see the Associated Press item. For a better explanation of the P vs. NP problem, see The Clay Mathematics Institute's explanations.<br></li>

<h1>How to Play Minesweeper Like a Pro?</h1>

<div class="newspaper">
<ul>
<li><h3>Learn the Patterns</h3>

Play Minesweeper long enough, and you'll learn where the mines are just by looking at the pattern of numbers. For example, you'll see the following combinations often.<br>
Learning to read these patterns is like learning to read a language. At the beginning, it takes a lot of time to recognize every single letter, but after a few years you can read quickly, without any effort. It's the same with learning patterns--after three years of playing Minesweeper a few hours a day, you don't have to think about where the mines are when you see these patterns.</li>

<li> <h3>Use Flags Wisely</h3>

If you play using flags, employ the "double-click" technique (press the left and right mouse buttons at the same time). This action opens all squares surrounding a square with a number, if you have marked the number of mines around that number. In the example below, you mark a mine in a corner and then double-click on the circled 1 to open the surrounding four squares simultaneously. This approach is faster than opening four safe squares individually using the left-click.<br></li>

<li>Here is an example of ineffective flagging:<br></li>
<input type="image" src="about3.png" alt="back">
<li>In this situation you have only one safe square, so you should open that square with a left-click instead of flagging the mine.<br></li>
<input type="image" src="about4.png" alt="back">

<li>In the situation shown above, the squares I've marked with a red dot present a 50 percent chance of losing, while the square with the green dot has only a 15.625 percent (Beginner and Intermediate) or 20.625 percent (Expert) chance to lose.<br></li>
